## Problem Statement

Given the dataset - Use the image folders `theory_left` and `car_1`.

### Information
**Stitching**: Stitching two image pairs involves aligning and blending them seamlessly to create a panoramic or composite image. This involves finding the transformation (translation, rotation, scale) that aligns corresponding points/features in the two images.

**Geometric Transformation Parameters**:
- **Translation**: Shift in the x and y directions.
- **Rotation**: Angle of rotation around a certain point.
- **Scale**: Scaling factor applied to the image.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Parameters that adjust for perspective distortion when images are taken from different viewpoints.

### Solve the Following
1. Define a metric which could be utilized for stitching two pairs.
2. If the image were to be smoothed by a low-pass filter, how would the stitching parameters' values change?
3. Define stitching quality.
